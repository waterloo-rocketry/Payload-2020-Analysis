# Payload-2020-Analysis

This script in its current state takes in inputs in csv format from "DIODE1.txt" and generates a graph upon running of the python file. Successful generation of the graph should also require internet access, as the compiled graph should be shown in a pop-up browser window.

The dependencies need to be installed before the script can be run (dated Oct.1st 2020).
